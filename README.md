I don't consider myself an Emacs afficionado, but I got used to it's keybindings, and now I prefer them in whichever IDE I'm using. I got frustrated by the differences between "c-x c-f" built in to IntelliJ IDEA, and the emacs function it's supposed to emulate, so I decided to build my own.

Currently it can be used to navigate the file system with tab complete, list possible tab completions when there are multiple, and to open files when they are fully typed and the user presses enter.

I am still working on opening files by clicking on them in them in the list, and opening a list of files when the user chooses to open a directory.
